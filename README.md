## Introduction
This project focuses on the development of a filament dryer for 3D printing. The goal is to create an efficient and cost-effective solution to maintain filament quality by reducing moisture absorption.

## Objectives
- Design and implement a functional filament drying system.
- Ensure compatibility with various 3D printer filament types.
- Optimize energy consumption while maintaining drying efficiency.

## Scope
The project will cover the hardware and software development necessary for the drying system. It includes sensor integration, temperature control, and an interactive user interface.

## Summary
The filament dryer project aims to provide a reliable solution for 3D printing enthusiasts and professionals to maintain filament quality. By integrating sensors to measure humidity and temperature, the system can automatically regulate drying conditions. The design includes a user-friendly interface for monitoring and adjusting settings. The final implementation ensures that filaments are kept at optimal conditions, improving print quality and reducing failures due to moisture absorption.
